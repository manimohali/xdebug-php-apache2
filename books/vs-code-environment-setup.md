### 1. Using VS Code's Settings Sync

VS Code has a built-in Settings Sync feature that allows you to sync your extensions, settings, keybindings, snippets, and UI state across different machines.

#### Steps to Enable Settings Sync:

1. **Open VS Code**: Open Visual Studio Code on your current system.
2. **Turn on Settings Sync**: Click on the gear icon (⚙️) at the bottom left corner and select `Turn on Settings Sync`.
3. **Sign in**: You will be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft or GitHub account. Follow the instructions to sign in.
4. **Choose What to Sync**: Select the items you want to sync, such as settings, keybindings, extensions, etc.

When you move to a new system:

1. **Install VS Code**: Install Visual Studio Code on the new system.
2. **Turn on Settings Sync**: Repeat the steps above to turn on Settings Sync on the new system and sign in with the same account.
3. **Sync**: VS Code will automatically sync the extensions and settings from your previous system.

### 2. Manually Export and Import Extensions List

You can manually export your list of extensions and then import it on the new system.

#### Export Extensions:

1. **List Installed Extensions**: Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following command to list all installed extensions:
    ```bash
    code --list-extensions > extensions.txt
    ```

This will create a file named `extensions.txt` with a list of all your installed extensions.

#### Import Extensions:

1. **Copy the File**: Move the `extensions.txt` file to your new system.
2. **Install Extensions**: Open a terminal on the new system and run the following command to install all the extensions listed in `extensions.txt`:
    ```bash
    cat extensions.txt | xargs -L 1 code --install-extension
    ```

### 3. Use a VS Code Extension for Syncing

There are also extensions available that can help sync settings and extensions, such as `Settings Sync` by Shan Khan. However, the built-in Settings Sync feature in VS Code is usually sufficient and more integrated.

### Example Workflow

**On your current system:**

1. Open VS Code and export your extensions:
    ```bash
    code --list-extensions > extensions.txt
    ```

2. Ensure your settings are saved (e.g., `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`) and back them up if necessary.

**On your new system:**

1. Install VS Code.
2. Copy `extensions.txt` and any settings files to the new system.
3. Open a terminal and install the extensions:
    ```bash
    cat extensions.txt | xargs -L 1 code --install-extension
    ```

4. Import your settings by placing the backed-up `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` into the appropriate VS Code configuration directory (usually found in `~/.config/Code/User/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/` on macOS, and `%APPDATA%\Code\User\` on Windows).
